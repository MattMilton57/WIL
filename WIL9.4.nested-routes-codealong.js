// oof - lots to digest on this one. I think I will have to come back to it later when I need it so that I 
// can try to digest it again. It dealt with being able to click on diferent elements within a page (items 
// with previews on amazon etc) and and navigating to them while keeping the page consistant?

// investigate this further as i think it will be useful for the class stats pageand displaying info about 
// individual students.
